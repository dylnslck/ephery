Ephery is a dead simple, in-memory, client-side, fake API service. This tool is useful for prototyping client-side applications without hijacking Ajax. In particular, this tool was built to interact with React  + Redux applications that rely on an API service, but Ephery can be used for pretty much anything.

```
npm install --save ephery
```
